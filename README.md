About Me
--------

I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), pursuing my bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics & Computing, specializing in Artificial Intelligence & Applications. My primary interests lie in Deep Learning, with a particular focus on Multimodal Learning, where I am keen on exploring how different modalities like text, images, and videos can be integrated for enhanced AI capabilities.

Research Interests
------------------

*   **Artificial Intelligence:** Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Multimodal Learning, Interpretable ML
*   **Mathematics:** Probability, Bayesian Statistics, Sequential Analysis, Calculus

Experience
----------

1.  Counterfactual Video QA
    
    _Student Researcher - IIT Kharagpur_
    
    Currently working at [Tr2AIL research group](https://adityasomak.github.io/research/) under the guidance of Professor Somak Aditya to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) with a specific focus on video interpretation. This project involves developing innovative methodologies for counterfactual reasoning in videos, enabling the models to understand and predict alternate scenarios. The work aims to push the boundaries of how AI can analyze and reason about events in a visual context, opening up new possibilities for applications in various fields.
    
  
3.  Cognitive Distortion Detection[](https://github.com/tawseeq1/cognitive-distortions)
    
    _Student Researcher - Nanyang Technological University, Singapore_
    
    I worked under the guidance of [Dr. Farhan Ali](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp01643) to identify cognitive distortions using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We delved into the realm where language, mental health, and AI intersect. Using a vast Reddit dataset of over 31 million posts and comments, we investigated cognitive distortions among students and teenagers. Our approach involved analyzing patterns in sequences of 1-to-5-grams (n-grams), as outlined in the [Bollen paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2102061118), through time series analysis, NLP techniques, and LLMs. This project has the potential to reshape our understanding and approach to cognitive distortions in the digital era.
